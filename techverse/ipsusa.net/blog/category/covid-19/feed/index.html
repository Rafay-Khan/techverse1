										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever thought of revisiting your social media strategy amidst the crisis?</p>
<p>It has crossed the minds of many because the outbreak is unlike anything we have seen since World War II, one of the popular views in the global arena.</p>
<p>In the words of Governor New York, Andrew Cuomo, and I am paraphrasing it, 9/11 was nothing compared to what damage this virus has caused us.</p>
<p>The virus has brought countries like the United States and other developed countries with established safety nets down to their knees. However, there is no point in giving up, but to have our feet on the ground and fight on.</p>
<p>When social distancing and isolation are the new norms, social media is the perfect getaway for people to seek closure. They get to interact with business pages, speak up if they want to, or simply absorb the information they see and move on.</p>
<p>So, to have a social media strategy in place now calls for some thoughtful interventions.</p>
<h2><strong>Expert Opinions</strong></h2>
<p>Tech Crunch writes Facebook and Instagram see a 40% surge in usage during COVID-19, with twice the number of views on Instagram Live and Facebook Live.</p>
<p>One of the Instagram experts said, and I am paraphrasing it, that this is not the season to be quiet but to communicate. However, it is time to be vocal with the right choice of words and emotions. Because we have people in homes grieving for their loved ones and those who are still suffering from coronavirus and haven‚Äôt recovered. Keeping all the excruciating factors in mind, we should carve out a supportive, reflective, and objective social media strategy moving forward.</p>
<h2><strong>Strengthen Your Bond with Your Audience</strong></h2>
<p>Since most of the audiences are in isolation and prefer social media to interact with people, it presents you with a unique opportunity to strengthen your bond with them. Moreover, brand awareness can simply go to the next level these days.</p>
<p>That being said, stay mindful of the situation at hand by not being overly involved in your sales pitches. It may make you appear tone-deaf to people with increased anxieties and sensitivities.</p>
<p>We are passing through a difficult time, but instead of fearing it, we must be embracing it. It is time to reflect on the human side as much as possible. You never know what each person has to go through each day, who needs support, hence, words of kindness, empathy, and encouragement can be the difference. Look for the right balance between business and healing emotions, that is what‚Äôs required on social media.</p>
<p>Remember, we are all new to this pandemic, so in that sense, social media management in such times is news to all of us. Behold! We are in this together literally.</p>
<h2><strong>Listen and Accept</strong></h2>
<p>Ignoring COVID-19 or pretending that nothing has changed on social platforms can come across as insensitive or selfish to some people. Others might think you are tone-deaf. Therefore, let your followers know that you are well aware of the situation and you accept it.</p>
<p>To post something like: ‚ÄúIt feels weird to post about business at this time, but we don‚Äôt want our employees to lose their jobs‚Äù can go a long way in showing that you have eyes and ears open. Such a message sends a caring vibe across the board that is subtle enough to penetrate the heart. And winning over hearts is winning in real, right?</p>
<p>For instance, IPS USA provides business process outsourcing services to several industries; if we stop them, it will be wrecking our business with our bare hands. Despite doing that, if we choose to promote our services &#8211; <em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/digital-marketing/">digital marketing services</a></strong></em>, SEO services, or call center outsourcing services &#8211; not as explicitly as before, we are sure to have a good impact on our audience.</p>
<p>Kristin Cavallari, a celebrity and a business owner did a great job explaining why she was promoting a sale on her brand Uncommon James, by stating that she has 100 employees, and she will do everything in her power to help them keep their jobs.</p>
<p>It sounds simple, but she appears honest and aware of the current climate with an acceptable reason to keep looking for customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep Sharing¬†</strong></h2>
<p>It could be quotes, words of encouragement, or product images that you should keep sharing on social media. Your followers spend a lot more time on it, and you want to stay connected to them.</p>
<p>If you are unable to sell your products or services at this time, focus on ideas that reflect your brand values instead.</p>
<p>How you word your captions is crucial now to an extent that your audience will recognize your intentions through them.</p>
<p>For example: posting someone sitting by the pool with a caption saying ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs daydream: sitting by the poolside on a lazy afternoon. (shop through the link)&#8221; can put things in perspective.</p>
<p>@anthrolopogie on Instagram does that to good effect, generates decent customer feedback in the form of likes and comments.</p>
<h2>Empathize</h2>
<p>The next buzzword to follow on social media is empathy. COVID-19 has affected our lives in different ways. Remember to think about everyone, especially those most affected by the coronavirus, adding compassion and empathy in day-to-day posts.</p>
<p>With that being said, think twice when posting memes!</p>
<p>While there is no need to mention COVID-19 explicitly in all your content, the tone of your content should consider the sentiments of people passing through a different state of reality.</p>
<p>Remember that some of your audience members may just be trying to work from home with a baby; caring for an elderly at home, or fighting coronavirus as a patient themselves.</p>
<p>With all the above situations in the backdrop, create content that is satisfying to all. Unless there is a product you are about to promote, create content that reflects your brand‚Äôs depth as a habit.</p>
<p>So, there you go, now, you have a list of things with situational examples to follow. Another recommendation is to follow @shopbando on Instagram if you are an e-commerce business trying to make big. Not surprisingly, the best place to follow on Instagram is us @ipsusanet. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="üòä" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all are staying inside our houses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let‚Äôs be honest, we are bored and some of us might be going crazy literally (the extrovert types).</p>
<p>From BPO service providers, entrepreneurs, to call center Services, almost everyone from the business community is working from home.</p>
<p>We human beings are not designed to be stagnant. Constant routines bore us and staying at one place day and night is opposite to our basic instincts. In a parallel happy world, we all would be going out, doing chores, hanging out, and enjoying small things like going on a walk. But, the reality is we‚Äôre going through a self-quarantine period for GOD knows how long, so, it‚Äôs important to stay motivated, and not depressed with just a few activities.</p>
<p>Here are just a few ideas for you to relax during the COVID-19 isolation period.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Creative: Paint, Color, Draw</strong></h2>
<p>Structured coloring or doodling is an effective way to reduce anxiety, and it‚Äôs scientifically proven too. Psychiatrists often use complex geometric patterns to help adults deal with their anxiety.</p>
<p>So, if you have time to spear that we‚Äôre sure you do; draw, color, or paint as much as you like and color your negative thoughts with peace and tranquility.</p>
<h2><strong>Walk/Do Easy Exercises</strong></h2>
<p>Walking proves to offer mental health benefits, and it‚Äôs literally the easiest physical activity. Walking helps to release toxins, and a swift walk makes you creative. It also calms down anxiety and stimulates happy hormones.</p>
<p>At this hour, we can‚Äôt really go outside due to safety risks. However, a little indoor walk even if it‚Äôs for 15 minutes can help maintain our mental health. Accompanying walks with easy exercises adds up to the benefits.</p>
<h2><strong>Do Yoga</strong></h2>
<p>Another form of indulging in physical activities is doing yoga. Yoga assists in meditating and staying focused. Many of us are working from home, and sitting in the same position for a certain period can distort our posture, and eventually leave to permeant dent to health status.</p>
<p>Yoga is a great source of boosting self-esteem. You can learn and enjoy some yoga moves or postures to get positive energy for the day. There are many online yoga classes available. You can subscribe to any of them and tone your body while staying fit and healthy.</p>
<h2><strong>Sleep. Repeat.</strong></h2>
<p>Everybody loves taking naps, and there is no time better than this quarantine season to redeem our energies. Not just it strengthens our immune system but relaxes our muscles.</p>
<p>A healthy practice is to take seven to eight hours of sleep every day. Sleep-deprived individuals have weaker immunity, and they are more at risk of catching flu and other types of viruses.</p>
<p>Take a nap along your day, but for a shorter time to not disturb your regular sleeping cycle.</p>
<h2><strong>Talk/Chat to a Closest Friend</strong></h2>
<p>Just because we have to self-isolate ourselves, it doesn‚Äôt mean we have to be socially distant from our friends and family. Chat, call, facetime, and speak your heart out to your friends. Share how you doing and how your day went. This practice helps to boost spirits and deal with stress.</p>

<h2><strong>Listen to Music</strong></h2>
<p>Videos floating around of people singing in quarantine warm your heart. Now, make this time your time to sing and enjoy music. Sing along with your favorite singer on headphones or play any instrument.</p>
<p>Music has a positive effect on mental health. Listening to music boosts mood and reduces anxiety.</p>
<p>Staying in quarantine can be tough, but everyone‚Äôs safety also comes first.¬† Dealing with stress is no doubt not a child‚Äôs play. However, with some easy activities, you can make your days stress-free and ensure your safety without going outdoor. IPS USA, being a responsible platform of <em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/customer-support/">BPO services</a></strong></em>, has taken strict actions for the well-being of its team. Our team is working from home, planning, and designing strategies to meet our clients‚Äô goals. We also encourage our followers to maintain social distancing and work from home.</p>
