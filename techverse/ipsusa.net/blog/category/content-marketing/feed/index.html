										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Content marketing isn’t new to the industry. It started getting attention in the early twenties as blogging. However, it is a few years back, when businesses and BPO service providers saw its potential for generating leads.</p>
<p>Successful businesses where invest in other aspects of their companies, they also hire good content marketers to boost up the digital marketing strategies.  According to Neil Patel, the digital marketing guru, around 40% of the marketing budget is invested in content marketing.</p>
<p>Content creation has become so huge that brands pay others to design content for social media, which is a popular platform to reach the potential market and leads. Engaging content that relates to the public is needed by any company to make a loyal audience. Moreover, finding a person that makes such content is difficult, to say the least. So, do we suggest that finding a resourceful content marketer is tough? Of course not!</p>
<p>But, there are three major skills that companies and BPO services should look for while hiring for this position.</p>
<p>Let’s follow-through.</p>
<h2><strong>The Ability to Make Grammatically Sound &amp; Interesting Content</strong></h2>
<p>This is not a new criterion, but a very simple one. A content marketer should be able to produce grammatically correct sentences that also resonate with the audience.</p>
<p>However, the story doesn’t end here. There is a twist. With the advancement in the industry, marketers should know about the keywords and their placement to digitally benefit the hiring organization. To be honest, hiring managers miss out on this detail, and they end up with zero impression rate or low popularity on Google.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people have good speaking and writing skills, and social media has particularly helped shape a lot of good writers, benefitting the demand of content creators.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you write well but don’t know the bolts and nuts of grammar, you might not fit the content marketer’s job description. Spelling mistakes and bad grammar can hurt the brand’s reputation, and hiring managers should look into the interviewee’s grammar competence before hiring.</p>
<h2><strong>Curiosity &amp; Good Research Skill</strong></h2>
<p>A good content marketer should have the curiosity to research and validate content. It’s like journalism, where a journalist ensures that the information he presents is credible. Besides, it also adds credibility to the brands’ reputation.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/blog/how-to-choose-trustworthy-digital-marketing-services-in-usa/">How to Choose Trustworthy Digital Marketing Services in the USA?</a></strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Why it is important?</strong></h2>
<p>Because</p>
<ul>
<li>A marketer should research their audience’s interests</li>
<li>He should craft engaging content that reflects their brand’ integrity</li>
<li>It is a marketer&#8217;s responsibility to identify the competition and grasp loopholes in their marketing</li>
<li>A marketer should understand the company’s products and align its content with it</li>
</ul>
<p>Research is crucial for BPO service providers’ success. They have to generate outcomes for their clients, and without the intense power of research, intriguing content can’t be produced.</p>
<h2><strong>Data Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Content marketers are not supposed to be data analysts, but they should know how to read obvious data analysis reports. Successful content writers polish their content with data and numbers.  Research, again is crucial to product data-driven posts, that generally get more viral than the simple content.</p>
<p>It also helps in presenting the company as the knowledge base, and people build their trust over it. So companies should ensure that content marketers should know their way around numbers and data analysis tools.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/customer-support/">BPO services</a> </strong></em>and companies in general! You’ll find many people around with high salary expectations. However, it is not a parameter to judge a good content marketer. Beyond a degree, the above-mentioned skills will help you hire a good marketer and improve your marketing strategy and content.</p>
<p>Don’t you think?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In SEO terms when we talk about attention, it means getting backlinks from reputable sites. Backlinks are the most practiced way to get organic traffic for startups and small businesses. More sites linking to a landing page means higher rankings in the long term.</p>
<p>SEO services in the USA are unable to function to full effect if the backlinks lack quality.</p>
<p>The discussion brings us to our next question.</p>
<h2><strong>How do we get quality backlinks?</strong></h2>
<p>We can easily pay a handful of low-quality websites and ask them to link to us but the practice won’t get us anything in return. Instead, it will hurt our rankings permanently. Google, under its Penguin Algorithm, values quality over quantity of a backlink. Therefore, links from high-quality domains are essential to improve a page’s position in Google.</p>
<p>There are many ways to acquire backlinks but most of them depend on content. How valuable is it? Is it something of value and rather new that no one else on the web has produced so far? That kind of content attracts people and websites to start linking to it.</p>
<p>Regardless of the industry, it isn’t easy to come up with content that attracts backlinks. Here are 3 content ideas to be purposeful, innovative and target-driven at the same time.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/blog/leveraging-digital-marketing-services-is-an-elixir-for-brands/">Leveraging Digital Marketing Services is an Elixir for Brands</a></strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Research &#8211; Data and Statistics</strong></h2>
<p>Every content marketer needs facts to support their arguments. Usually, an article carries data and statistical information as evidence in support of the views in it. Therefore, the type of information that involves conducting research involving a group of people is creative and good for backlinks.</p>
<p>For instance, Ahrefs did a study on 1 billion web pages to find out how many pages got traffic from Google. The results of the study were alarming. Turns out, 90.88% of the pages never got any traffic from Google, and last time I checked, the page had received 844 backlinks.</p>
<p>I know it takes time to conduct your research, thus, calls for another way out. The second way is to collect statistics about the same topic from different sources and write them down as one single article.</p>
<h3><strong>So, there you go.   </strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Guide on Industry-related Topics</strong></h2>
<p>Another way to attract backlinks is to write tutorials or guides on specific topics. <em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/digital-marketing/">Digital marketing services</a></strong></em> in the US are likely to narrate such guides to create attention around their clients&#8217; pages. It could be an A-Z ‘how to’ article that explains the functioning of service. The advantage of this type of content is that when people don’t have enough space to explain something in full, they refer to your page.</p>
<p>Either do that or create a list of tools that help the audience in any way. For instance, lists of social media tools are popular. People usually don’t have the time to look for them one by one. Hence, articles that definitively explain such tools crucially help. If people find such tools in the form of an article and those tools are useful enough, they would refer to that article time after time. It could be a goldmine of referral traffic.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Visually Appeal to the Digital Corridors</strong></h2>
<p>What is visually appealing? Videos and infographics!</p>
<p>Infographics are one of the best ways to create backlinks because they are easy to share. It is as simple as it gets. Create an infographic befitting the audience of your website, find websites that share information on it, and make the exchange (publish infographic for something in return). See, now that wasn’t so difficult. Was it?</p>
<p>Backlinko has successfully done that. The infographic by Backlinko on ‘how to build backlinks using infographics’ boosted their traffic by 175%.</p>
<p>Video content is another way to grab attention. SEO optimization and video marketing both are tested ways to boost traffic. Video content is 12 times more likely to be shared on social channels than images and text combined. <em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/">IPS USA</a></strong></em>, as a social media marketing company, likes to be part of the digital scene. Consequently, the article narrates techniques for SEO success on every front.</p>
<p><strong>What is your secret recipe to generate high-quality backlinks?</strong></p>
