										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing worse than fewer phone calls, negligible online orders, and people rarely filling the contact forms on landing pages. It is the worst feeling for business owners, and I can well imagine the trauma they cause to digital marketers. AdWords, in this scenario, is a change to the status quo.</p>
<p>It comes to the rescue of both the CEOs and digital marketers, and most of the time it is what gives them the strength to move on. However, SEO services focus on creating an impact organically through SEO before moving on to paid ads. Online marketing in 2020 is a dynamic duo of SEO and paid marketing.</p>
<p>When we use AdWords, instead of worrying about the spending budget; we should have our eyes on the prize, the conversions!</p>
<p>Let’s look at three reasons AdWords are part of the winning strategy in competitive markets where everyone is aching to sell.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/blog/do-what-you-do-best-and-outsource-the-rest/">Do What You Do Best, And Outsource the Rest</a></strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>1.  </strong><strong>Pay for Quality and Intended Clicks</strong></h2>
<p>For us, AdWords, as part of our proactive digital marketing strategy, has a special place. It is where we make a difference for ourselves and our clients. Digital marketing agencies use paid campaigns to execute sales because they get the job done with minimum SEO efforts.</p>
<p>Generally, the more public name for a paid campaign is a <em><strong><a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/digital-marketing/">Pay-Per-Click (PPC)</a></strong></em> campaign in which you only pay for the keywords you intentionally bid on.</p>
<p>For instance, if I am a digital marketer, and I want to generate results for the keyword, “digital marketing companies near me”, I can bid on it to start things off. Furthermore, I will only pay when someone clicks my advertisement and goes to my site.</p>
<p>According to the Google Impact Economic Report, organizations make an average of $2 for every $1 spent on AdWords. Now that is amazing if you ask me and certainly motivates us to continue using it.</p>
<h2><strong> 2. </strong><strong>No More Staying in the Shadows</strong></h2>
<p>With paid ads through a veteran digital marketing service like us, compete with the big guns from the word go. Yes, nothing beats the feeling of overcoming the big names in your niche. While in the 80s and 90s advertisements on TV cost a fortune; an AdWords campaign starts with a minimum $300 investment today. $300 usually gives enough room to clicks once the campaign starts to run.</p>
<p>Special adjustments and enhancements are key to running successful campaigns. According to a survey by Clutch.co, 45 percent of small businesses use PPC advertising campaigns. As a result, it is safe to say that digital marketing in the 21st century consists of an effective AdWords strategy. Finally, an online marketing strategy without AdWords is incomplete.</p>
<p>Furthermore, proper use of the ROAS (return on advertising spend) metric guides your business into profit valley because you can double your advertising budget and play big. The ability to track the performance and invest more in the case of foreseeable profits is the real magic of AdWords.</p>
<h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Be Creative with the Titles to Outclass Your Competitors</strong></h2>
<p>People are usually fanatical about the quality score for AdWords. For some reason, they believe that placing the exact keyword they are betting on in the advertising copy can improve their quality score, and cost-per-click won’t be much. I tell you that is not the case.</p>
<p>Let me share with you a little secret. If everyone is bidding on the keyword, “IPS digital marketing agency” in the title of their ad; there is nothing different that you are doing from your competition.</p>
<p>However, the creative you are with those 60 characters, the better are the results. Innovate, invent, and stand out from the crowd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since PPC is the paid side of doing business, it is bound to reap results. However, to make sure it is done the right way, PPC management services have a critical role to play. We have just entered 2020, and it is for our good to know that the right combination of SEO and PPC turns into an ultimate solution.</p>
<p>Usually, we see SEO, PPC, and social media platforms as separate entities that are not exactly wrong, but the time we are passing through demands more of joint ventures than one-sided heroics. It means that paid marketing teams have to work in harmony with the teams responsible for optimizing the business on Google (SEO).</p>
<p>It is a known fact that data from your PPC campaigns is best utilized to boost your SEO results and vice versa. Let&#8217;s learn a bit more.</p>
<h2><strong>Keywords for SEO and PPC Management</strong></h2>
<p>Keywords hold a special place whether it is an SEO or a PPC campaign (Google Ads and Bing Ads). Keyword research is the first step that goes in for both of them. But keywords that you see generating profit in your paid campaign can easily be used to power your SEO campaign. Similarly, the keywords proving their worth in the organic world can support the PPC world.</p>
<p>SEO campaigns or organic campaigns will fire up once you apply such phrases in link-building efforts; you are bound to attract the big fish very quickly.</p>
<p>By big fish, I mean plenty of high-value customers. SEMrush is one of those dependable tools that allows you to look for a new set of keywords to target specific geographic locations and device types (mobile, laptop, desktop, or tablet).</p>
<p>In 2020, it is a good idea to use PPC ads for keywords that have too much competition. Use them to rank over competitors quickly. The struggle is worth all the effort when your paid ads bring high-value customers to your doorstep.</p>
<h2><strong>Use Google Analytics for Insights</strong></h2>
<p>To know which keyword is driving how much traffic, Google Analytics is the tool we use to see the results of our ongoing efforts. To find organic keywords, go to ‘Acquisition’, ‘campaigns’, and then ‘organic keywords.’</p>
<h2><strong>The Theory of Branded Keywords</strong></h2>
<p>Brand keywords can be a bit tricky. To take care of branded keywords, optimize for them, and also of your competitors. Hence, we are playing it safe for all the right reasons.</p>
<p>PPC management services could best make use of them in <a href="http://ipsusa.net/services/digital-marketing/"><em><strong>PPC Services</strong></em></a> to reign over search results and profitability charts. Profitability comes with leveraging branded keywords (your own and your competition) in your PPC efforts to create a magnetic influence over the top-tier of customers.</p>
<h2><strong>Strengthen Your Local Visibility</strong></h2>
<p>When we talk about the local audience, we are talking about people who live in the same city as yours. It can also include potential customers within your business radius. Gaining good visibility with moderate competition around the local circuit is difficult and demands the virtue of patience.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they take time&#8230;</p>
<p>It can be frustrating to wait for rankings as it can take a couple of months to show results. PPC management services in the US offer outstanding support in such cases through Google’s new Local Campaigns. This new application allows you to advertise across Google Maps, YouTube, and Google’s search and display mediums.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Creating campaigns based on thoroughly researched data goes a long way into your SEO and PPC management efforts. Such techniques involving data analysis improve your success on any channel without having to rely on cheap methods or ‘growth hacks’ which can lead to loss of customers.</p>
<p>The exchange of data from both the channels proves to be effective in landing customers and making those vital sales. All you have to do is to achieve splendid synergy between them for optimum results.</p>
