It is easy for a BPO services provider to develop a website on WordPress \u2013 one of the easiest coding platforms. However, the difficult task begins when they have to do its SEO, which is not so easy task.<\/p>\n<p>The SEO team of BPO companies requires not to think out of the box necessarily to increase the impression rate for a website. Moreover, SEO is not just about keyword placement and link building. Digital marketers and <em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/ipsusa.net\/services\/customer-support\/\">BPO services providers<\/a><\/strong><\/em> have literally come a long way ahead from just the traditional optimization techniques.<\/p>\n<p>More or less, every website can be ranked on a higher SERP with the appropriate SEO tactics. But, if we particularly talk about the WordPress website, the following useful tips can help SEO specialists.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Choose Web Hosting Carefully<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you work as an SEO expert for a BPO company, you\u2019ll be well-familiar that the page loading factor plays an important part in Google ranking.<\/p>\n<p>If your website doesn\u2019t load fast enough, you might lose heavy traffic. Therefore, consult your hosting provider to know the reasons why the site is not performing well. It might also be possible that the server is slow and is not capable to host your site.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Launch Blogs until you\u2019re Fully Prepared<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t allow the search engine to crawl the blog section of your website until you\u2019re done working on its structure.<\/p>\n<p>You can turn off this option by changing the settings. One advantage of this tactic is that you don\u2019t let the search engine bots crawl through the unfinished sections; and consequently, the site is not ranked for rough content on SERP.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Go for an XML Sitemap<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>XML sitemap plugins are essential for WordPress Blogs. Generally, sitemaps offer a complete guide to each page and content of the website. It helps search engines to crawl websites efficiently and increase their chances of higher SERP.<\/p>\n<p>An XML sitemap is easy to design and helps in the faster indexing process. Thus, try installing the XML sitemap plugin.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use a Professional SEO plugin<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A good SEO plugin automatically assists in SEO tasks. In addition, the trick is to use rel = \u201ccanonical\u201d for blogs. Often WordPress sites have to deal with the duplicate content issue. However, with this tag, you allow the search engine to check the original source of the links in the content.<\/p>\n<p>There are many SEO plugins in the market such as,<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress SEO<\/li>\n<li>SEMrush<\/li>\n<li>All In One SEO<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can use any of them, depending on the type of features you want.<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/ipsusa.net\/blog\/3-dos-donts-of-social-media-marketing\/\">3 Do\u2019s &amp; Don\u2019ts of Social Media Marketing<\/a><\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Use Dummy Links<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Links that are attributed with the \u201cNoFollow\u201d tag are generally useless. Even if SEO specialists use them, you can\u2019t guarantee the reliability of the used link. Therefore, the webmasters in the BPO companies should not use plenty of this tag.<\/p>\n<p>According to Google, web developers should use the \u201cNoFollow\u201d tag with links that are unrelated to the websites, and when you don\u2019t want Google to crawl them. Such as, on PPC ads.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>CDN Enhanced Site\u2019s Efficiency<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>CDN (Content Delivery Network) refers to a distributed network of servers. It helps in providing content for a segmented audience. Such as, as per geographical region or location of a user.<\/p>\n<p>It is particularly useful for a heavy website that has a lot of things going on in its content.\u00a0 This system puts pieces of content across the network and offers that information to users, closer to the server\u2019s location.\u00a0 Consequently, page loading time and response time is reduced remarkably, and your WordPress site has more chances of getting on top of SERP.<\/p>\n<p>Although, designing a website is already a tough job, but getting it on prominent search engine result pages is also not a stress-free task. However, BPO companies can make use of the above-mentioned easy tactics to increase optimization for WordPress sites.<\/p>\n<p>Do you think of any tactic to do <em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/ipsusa.net\/services\/digital-marketing\/\">SEO Services<\/a><\/strong><\/em> effectively for your sites, let us know at LinkedIn.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many clients come to BPO companies for web development services.
